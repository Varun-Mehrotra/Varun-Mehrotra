# About Me
Hi! I'm Varun, I've been programming since 2013 and been doing technology related things my entire life! From humble beginnings with Minecraft servers, to competitive robotics I always try to keep myself busy somehow. 

I really enjoy learning and that feeling of learning something new motivates me like nothing else. 

# On the Go
Currently, I'm finishing up my degree (B.Sc.) at the University of Waterloo for Physics and Astronomy. 

In my spare time I like to pick up my bass, guitar or a video game. Right now I'm trying to learn how to slap well to play funky stuff!
