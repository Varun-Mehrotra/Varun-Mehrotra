HI! I'm Varun, I've been programming since 2013 and been doing technology related things my entire life! 

I really enjoy learning and that feeling of learning something new motivates me like nothing else. 

Currently I'm finishing up my degree (B.Sc.) at the University of Wwaterloo for Physics and Astronomy. 

In my spare time, I like to pick up my bass, guitar or a video game. Right now I'm trying to learn how to slap well to play funky stuff!
